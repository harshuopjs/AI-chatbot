# AI Chatbot using Google Gemini API

This project implements a simple AI chatbot powered by the Google Gemini API.  It allows users to interact with a Gemini model and receive text-based responses.

## Overview

This chatbot provides a basic interface to interact with Google's Gemini AI models.  You can send prompts to the chatbot, and it will generate responses based on the model you've configured.  This project is intended as a starting point for building more sophisticated applications using the Gemini API.

## Features

*   **Text-based interaction:**  The chatbot accepts text prompts as input and provides text responses.
*   **Configurable model:**  Allows you to specify which Gemini model to use (e.g., `gemini-1.5-pro-latest`).
*   **API key authentication:**  Secures access to the Google Gemini API using an API key.
*   **Basic error handling:** Provides basic error messages in case of API errors.
*   **Simple implementation:** Designed to be easily understood and modified.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you will need the following:

*   **Node 18 or higher:**  Make sure you have Node.js installed on your system.
*   **Google Cloud Project:** You need a Google Cloud project to enable the Gemini API.
*   **Gemini API Key:**  You'll need to obtain an API key from the Google AI Studio.  Instructions for obtaining an API key are provided below.

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>  # Replace with your actual repository URL
    cd <your-repository-directory>    # Replace with your directory name
    ```

2.  **Install the required dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm i
    ```

## Obtaining a Google Gemini API Key

1.  **Go to Google AI Studio:**  Visit [https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey).  You will need to log in with your Google account.

2.  **Create an API Key:**  Follow the instructions on the Google AI Studio page to create a new API key.

3.  **Restrict API Key (Highly Recommended):**  For security reasons, it's strongly recommended that you restrict your API key's usage.  You can restrict it by:

    *   **Application restrictions:**  Limit usage to specific applications (e.g., your website's domain).
    *   **API restrictions:**  Restrict the API key to only be used with the Gemini API.

4.  **Store your API Key securely:** **Do not hardcode your API key directly into your script.**  Instead, use one of the following methods:

    *   **Environment Variable:**  Set an environment variable named `GOOGLE_API_KEY` with your API key as the value.  This is generally the most secure approach.  On Linux/macOS:

        ```bash
        export GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"  # Replace with your actual API key
        ```

        On Windows:

        ```bash
>
        ```

    *   **.env file (Recommended):** Create a file named `.env` in the project directory and add the following line:

        ```
        API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"  # Replace with your actual API key
        ```

        Then, load the environment variables using the `python-dotenv` library.

## Configuration

1.  **(If using .env file):**  Ensure you have created the `.env` file and added your API key.  The code should automatically load the API key from the `.env` file using the `python-dotenv` library.

2.  **Model Selection:**  The `model` variable in your code (e.g., `gemini_pro`) determines which Gemini model will be used.  You can change this to experiment with different models.  Refer to the Gemini API documentation for a list of available models.  Examples:

    *   `gemini-1.5-pro-latest`
    *   `gemini-pro`
    *   `gemini-pro-vision`

## Usage

1.  **Run the chatbot script:**

    ```bash
    node main.js  # Or whatever the name of your main script is
    ```

2.  **Interact with the chatbot:**  The script will prompt you to enter a message.  Type your message and press Enter.  The chatbot will generate a response.  Type "exit" or "quit" to end the conversation.


## Error Handling

The script includes basic error handling for API errors. If you encounter errors, check the following:

*   **API Key:**  Ensure your API key is valid and correctly set.
*   **API Quota:**  Check if you have exceeded your API quota limits.
*   **Network Connectivity:**  Verify your internet connection.
*   **API Status:**  Check the Google Cloud status page for any potential outages.

## Security Considerations

*   **Protect your API Key:**  Treat your API key like a password.  Do not share it publicly or commit it to version control. Use environment variables or a secure configuration management system to store your API key.
*   **Input Validation:**  Implement input validation to prevent malicious prompts from being sent to the Gemini API.  This can help mitigate potential security risks.
*   **Rate Limiting:**  Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse and protect your API key from being exhausted.
*   **Data Privacy:**  Be mindful of the data you are sending to and receiving from the Gemini API, especially if it contains sensitive information.  Ensure you comply with all applicable privacy regulations.

## Future Enhancements

*   **Context Management:** Implement context management to maintain a conversation history and improve the chatbot's ability to understand and respond to complex queries.
*   **GUI:**  Develop a graphical user interface (GUI) for a more user-friendly experience.
*   **Customizable Prompts:** Allow users to customize prompts and model parameters.
*   **Model Parameter Tuning:** Add functionality for adjusting model parameters like temperature and top_p for fine-tuning the chatbot's responses.
*   **Multimedia Support:** Expand the chatbot to handle images and other multimedia content (if the model supports it).
*   **Integration with other services:** Integrate the chatbot with other services and applications.
*   **Advanced Error Handling and Logging:** Implement more robust error handling and logging mechanisms for debugging and monitoring.
